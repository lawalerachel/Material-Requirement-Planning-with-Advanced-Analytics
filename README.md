# Material Requirement Planning with Advanced Analytics
## Project Overview and Aim
A soap manufacturing company engaged my expertise to develop an Excel template for material requirement planning, integrating robust data analytics. 
The aim of the project is to design and deliver a comprehensive Excel workbook that serves as a powerful tool for monthly material requirement planning. The project specifically focuses on assisting the planning team in optimizing its production processes by ensuring a continuous and efficient supply of materials.
## Data Source
The data sources was gotten from the producing firm which include the following:
- The monthly production plan which serves as a primary data source, outlining the production schedule for the next three years. This data is essential for understanding the demand for different SKUs in various pack sizes.
- The opening stock of materials as of January 2024 is a critical data source. This information is regularly updated on a monthly basis to reflect the current stock levels and influences material requirement calculations.
- The material master data sheet contains detailed information about raw and packaging materials. This data includes unit of measure, material category, lead time, safety stock, and minimum order quantity.These parameters, provided by the producing firm, contribute to the calculation of safety stock, reorder levels, and other essential metrics in the material master data sheet.
- Information about the materials, including their origin (local or imported), is crucial for understanding the supply chain dynamics and potential lead time variations.
The accuracy and completeness of these data sources are essential for the success of the Material Requirement Planning model. Regular updates to the Monthly Production Plan and Stock on Hand data ensure that the model reflects the most current information for effective material planning.
## Tools
The primary tool for this project is Microsoft Excel. However, within Excel, several features and functions are utilized, showcasing a combination of data management, calculation, and analytical tools. Here are some of the key functions and formula used in the project:
- If statements
- Vlookup
- Sum product
- Index and Match
- Conditional formatting
## Result
The Material Requirement Planning sheet detailing planned usage, goods in transit, projected closing stock, and Days of Cover (DOC) per month for each material. The production schedule for finished goods was translated into time phased raw material requirements. The MRP sheet's conditional formatting features serve as a visual guide, allowing the team to quickly assess the health of material stock levels, projected Days of Cover, and required purchase quantities. These visual cues empower the team to make timely and informed decisions, ensuring that material planning aligns with production needs, minimizing the risk of shortages or excess stock. The user-friendly representation enhances the overall effectiveness of the material requirement planning process.

## Limitations
It's also important to note that the success of the data analytics techniques employed in the model depends on the quality of the input data. Any discrepancies or inaccuracies in the data sources could impact the reliability of the model's predictions and recommendations.
